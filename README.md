# Java Technologies
- Laboratories for the Java Technologies course at the Faculty of Computer Science Iasi.
- [Couse page](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/tj/)

## Laboratory 1
- **Compulsory:**
	I finished the compulsory. I had some problems with the project, when I pressed Submit on the form I was redirected to an error page 404, and even though I tried to change the servlet setup, it did not work.
- **Homework:**
	I finished all 3 points of the homework. I implemented another servlet in the same project (*Laboratory1*).
	- I created a method called *generateRandomTreeAdjacencyMatrix* in the servlet that generates an adjacency matrix with the given number of vertices.
 	- I printed the HTTP method used, the IP-address of the client, the user-agent, the client language and the parameter of the request (*numVertices*) in the log file of the GlassFish. This file is not uploaded on GitHub, but I will if necessary. An example of an instance is *[2023-10-15T12:28:05.079353+03:00] [GF 7.0.9] [INFO] [] [jakarta.enterprise.web.vs.server] [tid: _ThreadID=37 _ThreadName=http-listener-1(1)] [levelValue: 800] [[
  WebModule[/lab1-homework-1.0-SNAPSHOT] ServletContext.log():generateTree&#x3a; Number of Vertices&#x3a; 6]]*
	- I created a Python project named *Laboratory1HomeworkPart3* for the invocation of the servlet from a different desktop application. I tested it and it worked. 

## Laboratory 2
- **Compulsory:**
	I finished part of the compulsory, only sending one parameter from one .jsp file to another. 
- **Homework**
	In progress...
